## Reflection

This is a 1 week challenge project to *mercadolibre* from a Front-end position. Project goals included using technologies to show knowledge and fluency on javascript enviroment, as well as be able to put required tech requirements and ideas on a real project.

I started this project by using the `create-react-app` boilerplate on the frontend, it minimizes initial setup and with that, I could invest more time in diving into features, then adding `tailwind`, `react-router-4.0` and `redux`. The frontend application is tested using `jest` and `cypress`.

The backend was projected using `express` and `joi`.

Both frontend and backend have a ESLint configuration.
